  <To begin with, I copied the code from keyboard spheres into this file in order to save some time with the sphere class and the implementation of keyboard listener.  I used oracle for math related work including sin and cosine and math.pow:  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html  I used stack overflow about changing fonts https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16761630/font-createfont-set-color-and-size-java-awt-font  I used oracle for drawstring as well as specifics about graphics https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html  I used oracle for the testing method https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html  I also used https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/FontMetrics.html in order to find the correct locations to put the numbers at the top of the screen.   I used the website you gave us to see how the pong game worked.  I also worked with Clare a lot and met with you.>

Additional notes: <This is a soccer version of pong.  Very rarely the color of the rectangles is rather hard to see because we have random colors as our rectangles.  This can be remedied by simply running program again.>
